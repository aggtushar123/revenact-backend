class CustomerListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    """GET/POST /api/v1/customers/ — scoped to the caller's own
    organisation (tenant). Any authenticated user (admin or CSM) can list
    and add — unlike User Management, there's no admin-only gate here.

    GET supports `?search=` — matches against name (substring, case-
    insensitive) or Revenact ID (the row's own `id`, also substring —
    `id` is cast to text via `Cast` rather than relying on a database's
    own icontains-on-integer behaviour, which isn't portable). There's no
    separate "External ID" field in the schema yet, so that part of the
    frontend's search placeholder isn't wired to anything real.

    GET also supports `?renewal_within=<days>` — customers whose
    `renewal_date` is on or before today+<days>, ordered soonest/most-
    overdue-first instead of the model's default name ordering. No lower
    bound: an already-overdue renewal_date (the CSM hasn't updated it
    yet) is *more* urgent, not less, so it's included rather than
    filtered out. Excludes already-churned customers (renewal is moot
    for those) and anything with no `renewal_date` set. Powers the
    Organizations page's "Renewal" card/popover. A non-integer value is
    ignored rather than raising an error."""
